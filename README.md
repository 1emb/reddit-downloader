# reddit-downloader
This repos is for all out there who tried to download reddit data and struggle with it. This is my 9 months of pain.

The code I use here make requests to https://api.pushshift.io to download posts from a specific time frame. You can change the time frame/ repeat the code multiple time to download data from different time frame of different subreddit, read my code a bit and you can change the subreddit too.
